# Code Review Exercises

This repository contains some intentionally poor code that I have written, along with the mistakes included in the code. It
also has a fixed version of the code, which addresses all of the mistakes I called out in the solution documents. I plan
to continue adding projects to this.

The intention of this repository is to identify common mistakes made, and to give practice in reading and reviewing code,
especially for beginners.

The mistakes included are both functional (some of the programs don't work) and conceptual (some of them are poorly designed)
