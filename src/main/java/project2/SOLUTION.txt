The mistake in this code is that the if statement is totally unnecessary.

Whenever you see code like this:

if(...) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}

You can simplify it by just returning the result of the boolean expression in the if statement:

return(...);

See the fixed example for how this would be applied for the IsBetween class.

The reason this is the case is because the expression inside the if statement either evalutates to true or false.
If it evaluates true, we return true, else we return false.
This works, but it's much cleaner to simply return the result of the expression and cut out the unnecessary steps.
