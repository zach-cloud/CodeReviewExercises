This project represents an extremely simple calculator app. The program should ask the user for an operation (which can
be plus, minus, times, divide, or power) and then perform that operation and display the result to the user.

The program is implemented quite poorly - and in fact, is non-functional.

Can you discover all the problems in the code? Read SOLUTION.txt for the answers to what is wrong, and the "fixed"
folder contains a fixed version of this code.
