This code is a simple implementation of a Linked List. It is only singly-linked, does not implement the List interface (for
simplicity, since I only implement so few methods), and only implements add, get, and size.

Despite the simplicity, each method has at least one severe implementation flaw, as well as design flaws for the entire class.
See if you can find all the bugs without testing/running it.
